# BikeMorgantown 
A community website for  tracking events and information about biking in Morgantown, West Virginia. A ongoing full-stack project. I created the design using Figma. I created the frontend using NextJS to utilize server side rendering to fetch data from a API on each refresh and components to bootstrap the HTML/CSS quickly and efficiently with a mobile first approach. The API used for data is an instance of Directus hosted on a DigitalOcean VPS using docker-compose to ensure efficient deployments and keep hosting costs down. The frontend of the site is hosted on Vercel. The Domain and DNS is handled through AWS Route 53 for full control.
