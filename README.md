# BikeMorgantown 
BikeMorgantown is a community website for tracking events and information about biking in Morgantown, West Virginia. It is designed using wireframing tools such as Figma with a mobile-first approach. The frontend was implemented using the React framework NextJS which enables efficient server-side rendering. The backend is created through the Directus platform, hosted on a DigitalOcean VPS, and deployed using docker-compose. These technologies allow for quick development, efficient deployment, and helps maintain low hosting cost. The website Domain and DNS is handled with AWS Route 53. The final product is committed to a GitHub repository where it is built and hosted on the Vercel platform.
